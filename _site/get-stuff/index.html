<h2 id='primary_user_for_a_partner_account'>Primary User for a Partner Account</h2>

<p>Upon creation of a partner account, a user is automatically created as the default/primary for that partner. This user has an associated public and private key for API interactions, as well as a username and password for UI-based authentication. All operations initiated by the partner to LML (including the creation of additional users) should use these credentials.</p>
